dbrvstatdiff - evaluate statistical differences between two random
======================================================================


*NOTE: this page was directly converted from the perl FSDB manual pages from FSDB version 3.1*

SYNOPSIS
--------

dbrvstatdiff [-f format] [-c ConfRating] [-h HypothesizedDifference] m1c
sd1c n1c m2c sd2c n2c

OR

dbrvstatdiff [-f format] [-c ConfRating] m1c n1c m2c n2c

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Produce statistics on the difference of sets of random variables. If a
hypothesized difference is given (with ``-h``), to does a Student's
t-test.

Random variables are specified by:

"m1c", "m2c"
   The column names of means of random variables.

"sd1c", "sd2c"
   The column names of standard deviations of random variables.

"n1c", "n2c"
   Counts of number of samples for each random variable

These values can be computed with dbcolstats.

Creates up to ten new columns:

"diff"
   The difference of RV 2 - RV 1.

"diff_pct"
   The percentage difference (RV2-RV1)/1

"diff_conf_{half,low,high}" and "diff_conf_pct_{half,low,high}"
   The half half confidence intervals and low and high values for
   absolute and relative confidence.

"t_test"
   The T-test value for the given hypothesized difference.

"t_test_result"
   Given the confidence rating, does the test pass? Will be either
   rejected or not-rejected.

"t_test_break"
   The hypothesized value that is break-even point for the T-test.

"t_test_break_pct"
   Break-even point as a percent of m1c.

Confidence intervals are not printed if standard deviations are not
provided. Confidence intervals assume normal distributions with common
variances.

T-tests are only computed if a hypothesized difference is provided.
Hypothesized differences should be proceeded by <=, >=, =. T-tests
assume normal distributions with common variances.

OPTIONS
-------

-c FRACTION or --confidence FRACTION
   Specify FRACTION for the confidence interval. Defaults to 0.95 for a
   95% confidence factor (alpha = 0.05).

-f FORMAT or --format FORMAT
   Specify a **printf**â€†(3)-style format for output statistics. Defaults
   to ``%.5g``.

-h DIFF or --hypothesis DIFF
   Specify the hypothesized difference as ``DIFF``, where ``DIFF`` is
   something like ``<=0`` or ``>=0``, etc.

This module also supports the standard fsdb options:

-d
   Enable debugging output.

-i or --input InputSource
   Read from InputSource, typically a file name, or ``-`` for standard
   input, or (if in Perl) a IO::Handle, Fsdb::IO or Fsdb::BoundedQueue
   objects.

-o or --output OutputDestination
   Write to OutputDestination, typically a file name, or ``-`` for
   standard output, or (if in Perl) a IO::Handle, Fsdb::IO or
   Fsdb::BoundedQueue objects.

--autorun or --noautorun
   By default, programs process automatically, but Fsdb::Filter objects
   in Perl do not run until you invoke the **run()** method. The
   ``--(no)autorun`` option controls that behavior within Perl.

--help
   Show help.

--man
   Show full manual.

Case 3:
-------

A common use case is to have one file with a set of trials from two
experiments, and to use dbrvstatdiff to see if they are different.

*Input 3:*

#fsdb case trial value a 1 1 a 2 1.1 a 3 0.9 a 4 1 a 5 1.1 b 1 2 b 2 2.1
b 3 1.9 b 4 2 b 5 1.9

Command 3:
----------

cat two_trial.fsdb \| dbmultistats -k case value \| dbcolcopylast mean
stddev n \| dbrow \_case eq "b" \| dbrvstatdiff -h =0 mean stddev n
copylast_mean copylast_stddev copylast_n \| dblistize

*Output 3:*

(So one cannot say that they are statistically equal.)
